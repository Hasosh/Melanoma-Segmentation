# Melanoma-Segmentation

Melanoma, which is the deadliest form of skin cancer, is accountable for most fatalities caused by skin cancer. As of 2015, there were more than 350,000 cases of melanoma worldwide, resulting in nearly 60,000 deaths. Though the mortality rate of melanoma is significant, the chances of survival are estimated to be over 95% when it is diagnosed in the early stages. Consequently, the proper segmentation of moles is a crucial and vital step in detecting melanoma early.

This is an implementation of a model for the ISIC 2016 Challenge - Task 1: Lesion Segmentation [1]. The model is based on a **U-net segmentation method** and has undergone fine-tuning with data-augmentation techniques and parameter optimization. These additional steps have helped to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the model, ensuring that it performs well in detecting and segmenting moles more accurately. The model segments moles with a **Dice score of 87.95%**.
